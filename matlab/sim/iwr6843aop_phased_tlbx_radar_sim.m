%% FMCW Waveform Generation
% define waveform properties
fc     = radar.Freq_Center_hz;
c      = 3e8;
lambda = radar.Lambda_m;

% The sweep time can be computed based on the time needed for the signal to
% travel the unambiguous maximum range. In general, for an FMCW radar system,
% the sweep time should be at least five to six times the round trip time. 
% This example uses a factor of 5.5.
range_max = 125;
tm = radar.Pulse_Width_s;

% The sweep bandwidth can be determined according to the range resolution 
% and the sweep slope is calculated using both sweep bandwidth and sweep time.
bw = radar.Bandwidth_hz;
sweep_slope = bw/tm;

% Because an FMCW signal often occupies a large bandwidth, setting the 
% sample rate blindly to twice the bandwidth often stresses the capability 
% of A/D converter hardware. To address this issue, you can often choose a 
% lower sample rate. Consider two things here:

% For a complex sampled signal, the sample rate can be set to the same as the bandwidth.
% FMCW radars estimate the target range using the beat frequency embedded 
% in the dechirped signal. The maximum beat frequency the radar needs to 
% detect is the sum of the beat frequency corresponding to the maximum range
% and the maximum Doppler frequency. Hence, the sample rate only needs to 
% be twice the maximum beat frequency.
% 
% In this example, the beat frequency corresponding to the maximum range
% is as follows:
fr_max = range2beat(range_max,sweep_slope,c);

% Because the maximum speed of a person walking is about 0.5 m/h. Hence the 
% maximum Doppler shift and the maximum beat frequency can be computed as:
v_max_m  = 50;
fd_max = speed2dop(2*v_max_m,lambda);
fb_max = fr_max + fd_max;

% This example adopts a sample rate of the larger of twice the maximum beat
% frequency and the bandwidth.
fs = radar.Fs_hz;

% With this information, set up the FMCW waveform used in the radar system.

%% Radar Signal Simulation
% As briefly mentioned in earlier sections, an FMCW radar measures the range
% by examining the beat frequency in the dechirped signal. To extract this 
% frequency, a dechirp operation is performed by mixing the received signal
% with the transmitted signal. After the mixing, the dechirped signal 
% contains only individual frequency components that correspond to the target range.
% 
% In addition, even though it is possible to extract the Doppler information
% from a single sweep, the Doppler shift is often extracted among several 
% sweeps because within one pulse, the Doppler frequency is indistinguishable
% from the beat frequency. To measure the range and Doppler, an FMCW radar 
% typically performs the following operations:
% 
% 1.The waveform generator generates the FMCW signal.
% 
% 2.The transmitter and the antenna amplify the signal and radiate the signal
% into space.
% 
% 3.The signal propagates to the target, gets reflected by the target, and 
% travels back to the radar.
% 
% 4.The receiving antenna collects the signal.
% 
% 5.The received signal is dechirped and saved in a buffer.
% 
% 6.Once a certain number of sweeps fill the buffer, the Fourier transform is 
% performed in both range and Doppler to extract the beat frequency as well
% as the Doppler shift. can then estimate the range and speed of the target
% using these results. Range and Doppler can also be shown as an image and 
% give an intuitive indication of where the target is in the range and speed domain.
% 
% The next section simulates the process outlined above.
% 
% During the simulation, a spectrum analyzer is used to show the spectrum 
% of each received sweep as well as its dechirped counterpart.
specanalyzer = spectrumAnalyzer('SampleRate',fs, ...

    'PlotAsTwoSidedSpectrum',true, 'FrequencyResolutionMethod','rbw', ...
    'Title','Spectrum for received and dechirped signal', ...
    'ShowLegend',true);

% Next run the simulation loop
rng(2012);
Nsweep = radar.N_pulses;
xr = complex(zeros(waveform.SampleRate*waveform.SweepTime,Nsweep));

for n = 1:Nsweep
    % Update radar and target positions
    [radar_pos,radar_vel] = radarmotion(waveform.SweepTime);
    [tgt_pos,tgt_vel] = person_motion(1/radar.Prf_hz);
    [tgtrng,tgtang] = rangeangle(tgtpos);

    % Transmit FMCW waveform
    sig = waveform();
    txsig = transmitter(sig);

    % Add a radiate to capture all targets for this signal
    txsig = radiator(txsig,tgtang); 

    % Propagate the signal and reflect off the target
    txsig = channel(txsig,radar_pos,tgt_pos,radar_vel,tgt_vel);
    txsig = person_target(txsig);
 
    % Dechirp the received radar return
    rxcol = collector(txsig,tgtang);
    rxsig = receiver(rxcol);
    dechirpsig = dechirp(rxsig,sig);

    % Visualize the spectrum
    specanalyzer([rxsig dechirpsig]);

    xr(:,n) = dechirpsig;
end

% As a side note, although the received signal is sampled at high frequency so the
% system can achieve the required range resolution, after the dechirp, you 
% need to sample it only at a rate that corresponds to the maximum beat 
% frequency. Since the maximum beat frequency is in general less than the 
% required sweeping bandwidth, the signal can be decimated to alleviate the
% hardware cost. The following code shows the decimation process:
Dn = fix(fs/(2*fb_max));
for m = size(xr,2):-1:1
    xr_d(:,m) = decimate(xr(:,m),Dn,'FIR');
end
fs_d = fs/Dn;

%% Range Estimate
% First estimate the beat frequency using the coherently integrated sweeps 
% and then converted to the range.
fb_rng = rootmusic(pulsint(xr_d,'coherent'),1,fs_d);
rng_est = beat2range(fb_rng,sweep_slope,c);
fprintf(1,'Range Estimate \n\t%2.2f m\n',rng_est);

%% Doppler Estimate
% Second, estimate the Doppler shift across the sweeps at the range where 
% the target is present.
peak_loc = val2ind(rng_est,c/(fs_d*2));
fd = -rootmusic(xr_d(peak_loc,:),1,1/tm);
v_est = dop2speed(fd,lambda)/2;
fprintf(1,'Doppler Estimate \n\t%2.2f m/s\n',v_est);

%% Range Doppler Coupling Effect
% One issue associated with linear FM signals, such as an FMCW signal, is 
% the range Doppler coupling effect. As discussed earlier, the target range
% corresponds to the beat frequency. Hence, an accurate range estimation 
% depends on an accurate estimate of beat frequency. However, the presence 
% of Doppler shift changes the beat frequency, resulting in a biased range estimation.

% For the situation outlined in this example, the range error caused by the
% relative speed between the target and the radar is as follows:
deltaR = rdcoupling(fd,sweep_slope,c);
fprintf(1,'Range Doppler Coupling \n\t%2.2f \n',deltaR);

%% Unambiguous velocity calcuation
v_unambiguous = dop2speed(1/(2*tm),lambda)/2;
